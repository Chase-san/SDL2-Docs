<h1>SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick</h1>
<p>Use this function to get the Joystick ID from a Game Controller. The game controller builds on the Joystick API, but to be able to use the Joystick's functions with a gamepad, you need to use this first to get the joystick object.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<div style="codearea">
<pre>
SDL_Joystick* SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick(SDL_GameController* gamecontroller)
</pre></div>
<h2>Function Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>gamecontroller</strong></td><td>the game controller object that you want to get a joystick from</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>Returns a SDL_Joystick object; call <a href="SDL_GetError.html">SDL_GetError</a>() for more information.
<h2>Code Examples</h2>
<div style="codearea">
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* for printf() */
/* ... */
SDL_GameController *ctrl;
SDL_Joystick *joy;
int i;
for(i = 0; i < SDL_NumJoysticks(); ++i) {
    if (SDL_IsGameController(i)) {
        printf("Index \'%i\' is a compatible controller, named \'%s\'\n", i, SDL_GameControllerNameForIndex(i));
        ctrl = SDL_GameControllerOpen(i);
        joy = SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick(ctrl);
    } else {
        printf("Index \'%i\' is not a compatible controller.\n", i);
    }
}
</pre></div>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This function will give you a SDL_Joystick object, which allows you to use the SDL_Joystick functions with a SDL_GameController object. This would be useful for getting a joystick's position at any given time, even if it hasn't moved (moving it would produce an event, which would have the axis' value).
<p>The pointer returned is owned by the GameController. You should not call <a href="SDL_JoystickClose.html">SDL_JoystickClose</a>() on it, for example, since doing so will likely cause SDL to crash.
