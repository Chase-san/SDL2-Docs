<h1>SDL_GetKeyboardState</h1>
<p>Use this function to get a snapshot of the current state of the keyboard.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<div style="codearea">
<pre>
const Uint8* SDL_GetKeyboardState(int* numkeys)
</pre></div>
<h2>Function Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>numkeys</strong></td><td>if non-NULL, receives the length of the returned array</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>Returns a pointer to an array of key states. *A value of 1 means that the key is pressed and a value of 0 means that it is not.* Indexes into this array are obtained by using <a href="SDL_Scancode.html">SDL_Scancode</a> values. *The pointer returned is a pointer to an internal SDL array. It will be valid for the whole lifetime of the application and should not be freed by the caller.*
<h2>Code Examples</h2>
<p><span style="color:green; ">Is this entered correctly? Does the \code and \endcode go in or is that doxygen markup in the header? There is a different example in the old wiki.</span>
<div style="codearea">
<pre>
const Uint8 *state = SDL_GetKeyboardState(NULL);
if ( state[SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN] ) {
    printf("<RETURN> is pressed.\n");
}
</pre></div>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p><span style="color:green; ">*From</span> <a href="SDL_GetKeyState.html">SDL_GetKeyState</a> <span style="color:green; ">in old wiki.</span>
<p>Note: Use <a href="SDL_PumpEvents.html">SDL_PumpEvents</a>() to update the state array.
<p>Note: This function gives you the current state after all events have been processed, so if a key or button has been pressed and released before you process events, then the pressed state will never show up in the <tt style="backtick">getstate</tt> <span style="color:green; ">formatting here ok?</span>
<p>calls.
<p>Note: This function doesn't take into account whether shift has been pressed or not.
