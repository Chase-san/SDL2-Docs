<h1>SDL_LockTexture</h1>
<p>Use this function to lock a portion of the texture for <strong>write-only</strong> pixel access.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<div style="codearea">
<pre>
int SDL_LockTexture(SDL_Texture*    texture,
                    const SDL_Rect* rect,
                    void**          pixels,
                    int*            pitch)
</pre></div>
<h2>Function Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>texture</strong></td><td>the texture to lock for access, which was created with SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>rect</strong></td><td>an <a href="structures/SDL_Rect.html">SDL_Rect</a> structure representing the area to lock for access; NULL to lock the entire texture</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>pixels</strong></td><td>this is filled in with a pointer to the locked pixels, appropriately offset by the locked area</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>pitch</strong></td><td>this is filled in with the pitch of the locked pixels</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>Returns 0 on success or a negative error code if the texture is not valid or was not created with SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING; call <a href="SDL_GetError.html">SDL_GetError</a>() for more information.
<h2>Code Examples</h2>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you need to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the application level.
<p>You must use <a href="SDL_UnlockTexture.html">SDL_UnlockTexture</a>() to unlock the pixels and apply any changes.
